\description{
Biopsy features for classification of 569 malignant (cancer) and benign (not cancer) breast masses.
}
\details{
Features were computationally extracted from digital images of fine needle aspirate
biopsy slides. Features correspond to properties of cell nuclei, such as size, shape and regularity.
The mean, standard error, and worst value of each of 10 nuclear parameters is reported for a total of 30 features.

This is a classic dataset for training and benchmarking machine learning algorithms.

\itemize{
\item y. The outcomes. A factor with two levels denoting whether a mass is malignant ("M") or benign ("B").
\item x. The predictors. A matrix with the mean, standard error and worst value of each of 10 nuclear measurements on the slide, for 30 total features per biopsy:
    \itemize{
      \item radius. Nucleus radius (mean of distances from center to points on perimeter).
      \item texture. Nucleus texture (standard deviation of grayscale values).
      \item perimeter. Nucleus perimeter.
      \item area. Nucleus area.
      \item smoothness. Nucleus smoothness (local variation in radius lengths).
      \item compactness. Nucleus compactness (perimeter^2/area - 1).
      \item concavity, Nucleus concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour).
      \item concave_pts. Number of concave portions of the nucleus contour.
      \item symmetry. Nucleus symmetry.
      \item fractal_dim. Nucleus fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" -1).
