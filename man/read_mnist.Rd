\title{Download and read the mnist dataset}
\source{

}
\usage{
read_mnist()
}
\value{
A list with two components: train and test. Each of these is a list with two components: images and labels. The images component is a
matrix with each column representing one of the 28*28 = 784 pixels. The values are integers between 0 and 255 representing grey scale. 
The labels components is a vector representing the digit shown in the image.

Note that the data is over 200MB, so the download may take several seconds depending on internet speed.
